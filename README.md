harmony-java-client
===================

Java client for communicating with a Harmony Hub

Based on the work done to reverse engineer the Harmony Hub protocol by:
  https://github.com/jterrace/pyharmony/ and
  https://github.com/petele/pyharmony

Currently can't do much other than connect and get config.
